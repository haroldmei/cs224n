Answers to CS224n problem sets, practice exams; only contains written and coding answers, original problem sets please refer to Stanford Official course site.
This is for personal interest, you are welcom to use the material but keep in mind this is not guaranteed to be the right answer.
It is also really appreciated if you could point out anything wrong or provide any suggestions on improvement of my answer.

tfwarmup: Tensorflow practice
In this folder I implemented three different algorithms for language model: VanillaRNN/LSTM/GRU, to get myself familiar with tensorflow.
The dataset is from @dennybritz's rnn tutorial: https://github.com/dennybritz/rnn-tutorial-rnnlm. 
He's also got this very helpful blog http://www.wildml.com/2015/09/recurrent-neural-networks-tutorial-part-1-introduction-to-rnns/, pretty inspirational, thanks a lot!
